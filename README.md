# Standalone Lead Email Finder

A Python script to find potential email addresses associated with a company domain and optionally a specific contact name (like a CEO). It uses SearXNG for web searching and applies regex and filtering rules.

## Features

* Finds potential email addresses from public web data.
* Accepts company name or domain/URL as primary input.
* Optionally accepts a CEO/contact name to refine search queries.
* Uses a SearXNG instance for web searches.
* Extracts emails from search result text content.
* Filters results against a blacklist of common/generic email providers (e.g., gmail.com, hunter.io).
* Optionally filters emails to match only the target company domain.
* Handles domain sanitization.
* Outputs results as a JSON list or a simple text list (one email per line).
* Standalone CLI Tool.
* Configurable logging level.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python:** Python 3.7+ recommended.
2. **Pip:** Python package installer.
3. **SearXNG Instance:** Access to a running SearXNG instance and its base URL.
4. **Libraries:** `requests` (Install via `requirements.txt`).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository or download the script:**
2. ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aboodseada1/Email-Finder
   cd https://github.com/Aboodseada1/Email-Finder
   ```
3. Or simply download `standalone_lead_email_finder.py` and `requirements.txt`.
4. **(Recommended)** Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
5. ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
6. **Install dependencies:**
7. ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run from your terminal:

```bash
python standalone_lead_email_finder.py <company_input> -s <searx_instance_url> [options]
```

**Arguments:**

* `company_input`: (Required) The company name (e.g., `"Example Corp"`) or domain/URL (e.g., `example.com`).
* `-s`, `--searx-url`: (Required) The base URL of your SearXNG instance.
* `-c`, `--ceo-name`: (Optional) Full name of the CEO or contact person to focus the search.
* `-o`, `--output-file`: (Optional) Path to save the output file. If omitted, output goes to console.
* `-f`, `--output-format`: (Optional) Output format: `json` (full details) or `txt` (emails only, one per line). Default: `json`.
* `-l`, `--log-level`: (Optional) Set logging level: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`. Default: `INFO`.

## Examples

*(Replace placeholders)*

```bash
# Find emails for a domain, output JSON to console
python standalone_lead_email_finder.py example.com -s http://localhost:8080

# Find emails for a company name and CEO, output JSON to file
python standalone_lead_email_finder.py "Acme Corp" -c "John Smith" -s https://searx.example.org -o acme_emails.json

# Find emails for a domain, output only emails to text file
python standalone_lead_email_finder.py microsoft.com -s http://localhost:8080 -f txt -o ms_emails.txt

# Run with debug logging
python standalone_lead_email_finder.py google.com -s http://localhost:8080 -l DEBUG
```

## Output Format

**JSON Format (`-f json`, default):** Outputs a JSON object:

```json
{
  "query_details": {
    "search_name": "used search name",
    "target_domain": "identified target domain or null"
  },
  "found_emails": [
    "email1@example.com",
    "email2@example.com"
  ],
  "error": "Error message if any, otherwise null"
}
```

**TXT Format (`-f txt`):** Outputs only the found, valid email addresses, each on a new line. If no emails are found, it outputs `# No emails found`. If an error occurred, it outputs `Error: <error message>`.

## How It Works

1. **Input Processing:** Identifies if input is a domain/URL or company name; sanitizes domains.
2. **Query Generation:** Creates targeted SearXNG queries based on available info (domain, name, CEO name). Includes specific patterns like `"ceo name" "domain" email` and broader searches.
3. **SearXNG Search:** Fetches search results from the provided SearXNG instance for each query.
4. **Extraction:** Uses regex (`EMAIL_REGEX`) to find potential email addresses within the aggregated text content of search results.
5. **Filtering:** Removes emails from common/generic providers (`BLACKLISTED_DOMAINS`) and, importantly, **filters to keep only emails matching the identified `target_domain`** (if one was found).
6. **Output:** Returns the unique, filtered email addresses in the chosen format (JSON or TXT).

## Limitations

* Relies entirely on data available through SearXNG search results.
* Accuracy depends on search engine indexing and website content.
* The `EMAIL_REGEX` is broad and might occasionally match non-email strings (though unlikely with the `@` and `.` requirements).
* Filtering is based on the `BLACKLISTED_DOMAINS` list and matching the target domain; legitimate emails on other domains might be missed if filtering strictly by target domain.
* Does not verify if the found email addresses actually exist or are deliverable.

## Dependencies

* `requests`
